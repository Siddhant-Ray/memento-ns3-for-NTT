# ns3-fitnets

FitNets simulations with ns-3.

To run:

1. Use VSCODE "develop in container" (just works).
2. Use container manually.
3. Move into `scratch/` dir of local ns3 installation.

(TODO: More detailed explanation.)

In the container, you can use the `waf` command (its `./waf` with fixed cwd)

Must run `waf configure` to include fitnets in build.

TODO: python and notebook in container
